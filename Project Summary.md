Project Description:
Designed a smart dustbin using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and servo motor to automate lid movement based on proximity detection within 30 cm.
Built an IR remote-controlled car using L298N motor driver and dual IR receivers with Arduino Uno for directional control.
Implemented three speed modes (0.75 m/s, 1.5 m/s, 3 m/s) for the RC car, capable of carrying up to 2 kg with stable movement.
